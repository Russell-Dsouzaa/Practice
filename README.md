### In order to learn and practice DSA, as well as to improve my knowledge of different programming languages, I decided to solve problems on Leetcode and codewars.

* The reason I compiled all these problems into a single directory and pushed onto GitHub, is that I wanted to keep track of all the problems I had solved.
* I've only included my attempt on these problems, not including all the testcases and edge cases.
* These solutions are not meant to be executed without proper inputs.

    I've included a link to each of the problems in the respective problem's folder.
